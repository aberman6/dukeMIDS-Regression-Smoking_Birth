# Maternal Smoking and Birth Weights

Our model uses a subset of data from the Child Health and Development Studies, a comprehensive study of all babies born between 1960 and 1967 at the Kaiser Foundation Hospital in Oakland, CA, specifically, 1,236 male single births where the baby lived at least 28 days. The original reference for the study is Yerushalmy (1964, American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, pp. 505-518).

Our questions of interest include the following.
* Do mothers who smoke tend to give birth to babies with lower weights than mothers who do not smoke? What is a likely range for the difference in birth weights for smokers and non-smokers?
* Is there any evidence that the association between smoking and birth weight differs by mother's race? If so, characterize those differences.
* Are there other interesting associations with birth weight that are worth mentioning?

The RMarkdown file contains a report summarizing our multiple regression examining the effects of mother's smoking on birth weight.
